## 📊 Key Visual Insights

### 🏙️ Trends in Hosting Olympic Games
- Hosting has become consistent since the 1960s.
- Winter and Summer Games now occur alternately every 2 years.
- Wars caused large hosting gaps (e.g., 12 years between 1936 and 1948).

### ⏱️ Duration of Olympic Games
- Early durations were irregular and unstandardized.
- A few Olympics saw sharp spikes (e.g., early 1900s).
- In modern decades, duration has been stable.

### 🔥 Notable Historical Events
- Olympics were **cancelled** in 1916, 1940, and 1944 due to World Wars.
- Winter Olympics were decoupled from Summer Games post-1992 for alternating schedules.

### 🧩 Emerging Sports
- Sports like **Badminton, Judo, Skateboarding**, and **Sport Climbing** were added in recent editions.
- Olympics continue evolving to reflect global youth and cultural trends.

### 📉📈 Popularity Shifts
- Sports like **Swimming, Athletics**, and **Fencing** maintain consistent popularity.
- Events like **Art Competitions, Roque, and Aeronautics** faded over time.

### 🌍 Region-Specific Sports
- Some sports appeared only once due to **cultural relevance**, e.g.:
  - 🥎 Roque (USA)
  - 🎨 Art Competitions (France)
  - 🥍 Basque Pelota (Spain)

### ⚖️ Gender Disparities in Events
- Certain sports (e.g., Ice Hockey, Football) still favor male events.
- Others (like Swimming and Badminton) show balanced or female-dominant event counts.
- Clear progress toward gender inclusivity.
